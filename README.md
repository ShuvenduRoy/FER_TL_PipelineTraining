# Emotion_detection
Understanding human emotion from the facial image is difficult because of the very nature of complex human expression. What makes the problem more difficult is the way different people express their emotion and how little it can be understood from angles other than the strict front view. All the previous work on this topic tried to understand the expression on the front image view only. The complexity of the problem attracted researcher from computer vision to artificial intelligence field. In this work we approached to understand the expression from any angle with deep convolutional neural network. We also showed how pretrained model on some other dataset can be made beneficial in our task by training the fully connected layers and fine tuned the upper convolutional layers
